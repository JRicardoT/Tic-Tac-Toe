# Tic Tac Toe

#### A Front End Engineering project by [Ricardo Tovar](https://github.com/JRicardoT). Play it [here](https://jricardot.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/).

#### Description:
  A classic game of tic tac toe for two players!

##### How to play?
 The current player will place its token on any section of the board, once player one's turn is over it will switch to player two. This continues until a player gets a win. A player will win when they get 3 of their tokens in a row. This can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. If neither player places 3 tokens in a row, the game will then be considered a draw. There is no need to reset the game since it already does it for you! If a player does win the game, it will be displayed in their appropriate section.
